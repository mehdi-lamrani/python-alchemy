### Basic Repository Design Pattern Illustration with SQLAlchemy ###

The goal of this project is to get you acquainted with an implementation of the Repository Design pattern.
We will do that through an Object Relationnal Mapping (ORM) Framework called SQLAlchemy.
Alchemy natively implements a Data Mapper Design Pattern, on top of which this project adds a Repository Layer, to be able to switch from one Database Endpoint to Another. To illustrate this we will use 2 databases : SQLLite, and MySQL/MariaDB.
